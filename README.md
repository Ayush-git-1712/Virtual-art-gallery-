✨ Customization

Change the gallery title inside <h1>.

Add/remove artwork sections by copying a <section> block.

Modify the styles (optional) by adding CSS:

<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background: #fafafa;
    padding: 20px;
    line-height: 1.6;
  }
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    border-radius: 8px;
  }
</style>

📌 Notes

Ensure you add an anchor <div id="top"></div> at the start of <body> so that "Back to top" links work.

Test in multiple browsers for consistency.
